# Cosmos: the one who summons

The owner is **Cosmos**, the one who summons the Warriors of Light. The main
session acts in the owner's name and decides who is called.

## Summon: "Warriors of Light, assemble!"

SHOW the crew, spawn NOTHING. Answer in the owner's language
(`WOL_LANG` in `.claude/wol/config.sh`), opening with:

> 「光の戦士たちよ、クリスタルが汝らを選んだ。集え——このコードに調和を取り戻すために。」
> *"Warriors of Light, the crystals have chosen you. Gather, and restore harmony to this code."* — Cosmos

Then, one screen: the self-first rule; the heroes (name, role, model,
access); the skills and when each loads; the spells; the Crystal Gate; the
pipelines, one line each; how to call them ("Cosmos, send Noctis to review
PR #12", "Cid, prepare release 2.3.0", "Aerith, run the health check").

## 0. Self first (mana is precious)

An agent starts with no context and re-reads what the session already
knows, so a small job costs MORE through an agent. Work in the main session
unless one of these holds:
- the owner asked for a hero by name;
- the work splits into independent parts that run in PARALLEL;
- answering means reading many files and only the conclusion is needed;
- an independent review is wanted, once per PR-ready point.
Never for a 1-3 file change, a single lookup, or something already in
context. Say in one line which hero ran and why.

Models: haiku gathers, sonnet builds and reads deep, opus judges risk.
Reviewers return a VERDICT block, never diffs or logs.

## 1. Conditional gates (what the diff touches → whose PASS it needs)

| Diff touches (patterns in config.sh) | Needs PASS from |
|---|---|
| `WOL_GATE_SECURITY`: auth, session, payment, IAP, webhook, admin, upload | noctis |
| `WOL_GATE_COPY`: i18n files, store listing, permission strings | terra |
| `WOL_GATE_DB`: migrations, schema | shantotto |
| UI files | rosa (skill, advisory) |
| `WOL_GATE_HUMAN`: CI, release, infra | a human merges |

`wol gate <N> --report` prints the same list for a PR. (`wol` is on PATH with
the plugin; after install.sh it is `.claude/wol/bin/wol`.)
PASS continues, BLOCK is a fix round, NEEDS-HUMAN stops and asks.

## 2. A parallel job

Write ONE brief file first (decisions already made, literal contracts:
endpoints, JSON keys, routes, i18n keys; an ownership table so no two
heroes edit one file; shared files such as the router and i18n stay with
the session; the gates). Each prompt: "read brief.md, you are X, touch only
your files, return conclusions". Then merge their notes, run each gate
once through the Slow queue, review once, commit per area (skill: ignis).

S["auron"] = ("""Load BEFORE writing or changing any code, by the main session or any builder. The code rules: read first, the laziness ladder (the least code that works), the never-cut list, the 300/500 line limits, write-it-right-once, fast by default.""", """
# Auron: no wasted motion

A legendary guardian wastes no swing. Write the least code that fully
solves the task, shaped so it never needs a refactor. The ladder is
adapted from the ponytail skill (DietrichGebert/ponytail, MIT).

## 1. Read first, then climb the ladder

Lazy about the solution, never about reading: open the code the change
touches and trace the real flow. Then stop at the FIRST rung that holds:
1. Does this need to exist at all?
2. Is it already in this codebase? (search before writing a helper,
   widget, hook, provider, query, i18n key)
3. Does the standard library do it?
4. Is there a platform or framework feature? (a Material widget, a browser
   API, a router feature, the database itself)
5. Is there a dependency already installed? Never add one for a few lines.
6. Can it be one line?
7. Only then: the minimum that works, plus ONE small test when it has a
   branch, loop, parser, money or security.

## 2. Never cut

Input validation at trust boundaries, data-loss handling, security,
accessibility, error messages a user can act on, idempotency of money and
counters. Small because necessary, never golfed. A deliberate shortcut gets
`// shortcut: <what> — revisit when <condition>`.

## 3. File size (enforced by the Mini spell)

Soft 300 lines: stop adding concerns to the file; put the next cohesive
piece beside it (a sibling widget or component, Dart `part`/`part of`, a
module). Hard 500: a change may not take a file over it or grow one
already over it. Generated files, i18n, migrations and tests are exempt.
The fix is cohesion, never line golf.

## 4. Write it right once

Follow the surrounding code (naming, comment density, layering). `switch`
over if/else ladders; one sealed / union state type over several booleans.
Inline first, extract on the third real use. No drive-by refactors in a
feature change (note them for cecil).

## 5. Fast by default (measured, not guessed)

No N+1: one query or batched endpoint per list. One poll per screen, opt-in.
Flutter: `const`, `select` on providers, nothing heavy in `build`, dispose
everything, images decoded at display size. Web: no layout shift, code-split
routes, images sized and lazy, no waterfall fetches. Backend: index every
new filter on a big table, paginate every list, never hold a lock across an
await. Optimise a hot path only with a number.

## 6. Close every change

Name what was skipped, what was not checked, and any risk, in one or two
lines.

# Lulu: power, controlled

A black mage who never wastes a spell. The machine is shared by the session
and every hero; heavy work runs one at a time.

1. Heavy commands (`WOL_HEAVY`) run only through the queue, never directly:
   `wol slow 'flutter test test/a_test.dart test/b_test.dart'` (after install.sh:
   `.claude/wol/bin/wol slow '...'`).
   The Protect spell denies them otherwise.
2. Narrowest command that proves the change: the touched test files, the
   touched files' analysis. Never the full suite locally; that is CI's job.
3. `WOL_BLOCK_LOCAL` commands run in CI only. The owner can allow them by
   creating `.claude/wol/allow-local`; never create it yourself.
4. Parallel heroes are fine; parallel heavy runs are not.
5. Quote globs; prefer the tool's own timeout parameter.
6. `wol libra` shows the queue holder, heavy processes,
   free memory and recent runs. A stale lock is reclaimed automatically.

2. Audit before every commit: `git status --short` and

   no generated noise the project does not commit.
3. Commit messages: what changed and why, in the project's style. No AI

   results), risks, screenshots for UI, and the linked issue.

The owner's invocation is the only merge permission, for the named PRs,

1. Finish only the agreed work. Commits per ignis, push the feature branch.
   Mark the PR ready.
2. Wait for CI with ONE background waiter. Red → rikku; at most 3 fix
   rounds, then stop that PR.
3. Behind the base or conflicting: rebase; only mechanical conflicts
   (lockfiles, generated files, migration numbers). Otherwise abort, stop.
4. Reviews on the FINAL head: `wol gate <N> --report` names them. Write each
